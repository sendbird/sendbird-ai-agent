## New features

### React SDK quickstart and localization guides

Weâ€™ve introduced a dedicated documentation set for integrating Sendbird AI Agent with React. This includes a comprehensive quickstart guide and a detailed localization guide, making it easier than ever to embed the AI Agent Messenger into your React applications. The new guides cover installation, advanced features, and customization for both the predefined UI (FixedMessenger) and custom UI integrations.

Developers can now quickly get started with the React SDK, leverage advanced features, and localize the messenger experience for global audiences.

## Improvements

* Refactored the documentation and directory structure for JavaScript and React integrations, separating CDN and React sample apps for clarity

* Updated all resource links in documentation to reflect the new directory structure

* Enhanced sample code and examples to better demonstrate advanced features and real-world integration patterns

* Improved cleanup and context management in sample applications to help developers avoid common pitfalls

## Fixes

* Fixed broken links and outdated references in documentation after the directory restructure

## Behind the scenes

* Migrated JavaScript documentation and code samples to a new `js/cdn/` directory

* Created a new `react/` directory with its own `README.md` and `MULTILANGUAGE.md` for React-specific docs

* Updated `sample/package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` to include the new React SDK dependency

* Refactored and modularized sample app components to support both CDN and React integration paths

* Improved code cleanup logic for messenger instances in React and CDN demos

* Updated internal code samples to match the latest SDK API and best practices
