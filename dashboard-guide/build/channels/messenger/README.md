# Messenger

Whether you’re using traditional CX platforms or incorporating our web and mobile SDKs, Sendbird AI Agent delivers a unified, real-time experience at every touchpoint. By simply adding our SDK to your client app, you can streamline operations and provide swift, accurate support—enhancing both efficiency and customer satisfaction.

**Messenger channels** are in-app chat interfaces powered by Sendbird Chat SDK. They enable your AI agent to interact with users directly within your client app. The **Messenger** page contains the AI agent’s credentials required for implementation, such as the application ID and AI agent ID.

In Messenger, you can view and configure the messenger channel settings in the following tabs:

* [Conversation settings](../../../evaluate/conversations/)
* [Appearance](appearance.md)
* [Basic information](basic-information.md)
