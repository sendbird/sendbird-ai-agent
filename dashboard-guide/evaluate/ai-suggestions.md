# AI suggestions

**AI suggestions** help you improve your AI agent’s performance by identifying common user pain points. The system analyzes recent conversations and automatically surfaces insights where the agent may lack knowledge or underperform, allowing you to proactively enhance your AI setup.

**Suggestions are refreshed daily** based on conversation data collected over the past 24 hours. Each suggestion highlights a recurring issue or pattern detected during that day’s interactions. The total number of daily conversations is calculated using the AI agent's conversation history and can be verified in the Conversations tab under **Evaluate**.

You can find these action items under **Evaluate > AI suggestions** in the left navigation bar.

AI Suggestions can be generated 30 days after the AI agent is activated.

## **How to use AI suggestions**

### **Step 1: Review AI Suggestions**

* Take a look at AI-powered recommendations categorized by Knowledge, Safeguards, Tools, and Manuals to improve different aspects of AI performance.
* Prioritize suggestions with high, medium, or low urgency to focus on critical improvements first.
* Track progress with status labels such as To Do, In Progress, Done, or Won’t Do to manage implementation efforts.

### **Step 2: Implement AI suggestions**

* Implement suggested updates to improve AI performance.
* Use performance metrics such as CSAT scores, resolution rates, and handoff frequency to measure improvements via Overview, Categories and Conversations.

### Best practices

* Prioritize High-impact suggestions first—they signal more users are running into the same issue.
* Review related conversations before taking action.
* Use the **Mark as done** buttons to address or resolve the suggestion directly.
