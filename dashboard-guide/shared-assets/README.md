# Shared assets

In Sendbird AI Agent, **shared assets** refer to resources like [Knowledge](knowledge.md), [Actionbooks](actionbooks/), [Message templates](message-templates.md), and [Tools](tools.md) that are created at the workspace level and automatically shared across all AI agents within that workspace. These assets help ensure consistency, reduce duplication, and simplify maintenance. While they are centrally managed in Workspace settings, each AI agent can selectively enable or disable these shared assets in their own Build tab to tailor the experience for their specific use case.

**When to use shared assets**

* Use shared assets to keep content consistent across multiple agents in the same region.
* Use agent-level toggles to customize which assets are active per agent without duplicating content.
* Create a new **workspace** if you need a separate set of assets for a different region or organizational structure.
