# AI copilot

With Sendbird AI agent and Desk integration, Sendbird Desk agents can leverage the powerful features that AI agents have to offer through AI copilot. Once the copilot is enabled and accessible to human agents in Sendbird Desk, it can not only boost the productivity of those agents but also improve the customer experience for users. The features of AI copilot include:

* Conversation summary: provides a contextual summary of the ticket conversation, helping Desk agents to identify the customer issue at a glance.
* Knowledge search: sifts through all the knowledge instantly and provides the most relevant resources that human agents need.
* Response suggestions: generates a reply in various tones and lengths.
* Drag and ask: a shortcut to AI copilot - simply drag on a user's message and right-click the block. This reveals the **Ask AI** button for a quick question.
* AI activity log: lists the Knowledge references that AI copilot used to generate the message. This appears at the bottom of each AI message.
* Evaluate AI responses: allows you to rate AI responses by giving them a thumbs up or down. The rating buttons appear at the bottom of each AI message.

## Where to find AI copilot

The AI copilot is available at the two places:

* In the ticket view: This allows agents to utilize the AI-powered features while communicating with a customer. This copilot has both a contextual understanding of the customer's issue and an access to Knowledge data linked to it.

* In the left menu bar: This allows agents to view to their previous conversations with the AI copilot and get more general information regarding the customer support policy and workflow they need to follow.
