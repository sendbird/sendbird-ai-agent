# Sendbird Desk

Sendbird has our own customer support service called [**Sendbird Desk**](https://sendbird.com/docs/desk), which can also be integrate with AI agents for streamlined CX operation and management. The Sendbird Desk integration enables seamless customer support experiences by combining automation with human expertise. This integration allows you to:

* Hand off conversations to human agents: For complex queries or escalations, AI Agent can transfer conversations to human agents in Sendbird Desk. The integration ensures that agents receive full conversation context, enabling faster and more personalized customer service.
* Automatically create tickets: When an AI Agent identifies issues that require further attention, it can automatically generate tickets in Sendbird Desk with all relevant conversation details. This ensures a smooth transition to your ticketing system for effective issue tracking and resolution.

## **Before you begin**

When an AI agent hands off a conversation, it invites a human agent to the channel, shares a brief summary of the interaction, and exits. To let the human agent view previous messages, enable **Chat history** under **Settings > Chat > Channels** in your Desk dashboard.
