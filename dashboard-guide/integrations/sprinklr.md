# Sprinklr

The Sprinklr integration with Sendbird’s AI Agent facilitates seamless customer experience by blending intelligent automation with human assistance. This integration allows AI agent to:

* Hand off conversations to human agents: For complex queries or escalations, AI Agent can transfer conversations to human agents in Sprinklr. The integration ensures that agents receive full conversation context, enabling faster and more personalized customer service.
* Leverage Sprinklr articles for instant answers: If you already have multiple customer support articles in Sprinklr, AI agents can easily reference them when handling user queries, instead of you building it from scratch.
