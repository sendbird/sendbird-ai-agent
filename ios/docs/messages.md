## Key features

The core features supported for messages in Delight AI agent include:

- [Read receipt](#read-receipt)
- [Citation](#citation)
- [Special notice](#special-notice)

### Read receipt

Messages in a conversation can display their read status, indicating when they have been viewed by participants. By default, read status isn't displayed, but it can be enabled through `AIAgentMessenger.config`.

```swift
import SendbirdAIAgentMessenger

// Enable message receipt state
AIAgentMessenger.config.conversation.list.isMessageReceiptStateEnabled = true
```

#### SDK configuration

The read receipt feature can also be controlled through the SDK configuration:

```swift
// Access conversation list configuration
let listConfig = AIAgentMessenger.config.conversation.list

// Enable or disable read receipts
listConfig.isMessageReceiptStateEnabled = true  // Show read receipts
listConfig.isMessageReceiptStateEnabled = false // Hide read receipts
```

When enabled, messages can also display visual indicators as following:

- Sent status
- Read status with timestamp

### Citation

**Citation** feature displays source information of AI agent responses, allowing users to see the references and sources that the AI agent used to generate its responses. This feature provides transparency and credibility to the AI agent's answers.

- Default: Disabled by default.
- Configuration: Requires dashboard configuration to be displayed.
- Activation settings: Adjustable through dashboard configuration values.

#### Implementation

**Citations** are automatically rendered by the SDK when provided by the AI agent. No additional code is required in your iOS application - the feature is configured entirely through Delight AI dashboard.

When enabled, citations appear as:

- Source links or references.
- Document titles.
- URL references.
- Knowledge base articles.

Citations appear inline within the message content, providing users with source references and additional context for the AI agent's responses. They display as clickable elements that can expand and collapse, with more details about the source.
